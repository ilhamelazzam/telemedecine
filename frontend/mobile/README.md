# Mobile (Expo) app for Telemedecine

This folder contains an Expo-managed React Native app (TypeScript) migrated from the web frontend.

Quick start

```powershell
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

Notes
- Update `src/config.ts` to point `API_URL` at your backend.
- The app currently contains placeholder screens for patient flows and analysis. Continue migrating UI components as needed.
- To test on a device install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code.
